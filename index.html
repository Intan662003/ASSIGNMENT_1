    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
       <img src="Mypicture.jpg" alt="This is me!" width="350" height="450" class="image">
       My name is Intan Syafiqah binti Ahmad Faishal. I am 22 years old, born on 6 June 2003 at Hospital Tanjung Karang, Selangor. I have four siblings, and I am the eldest among them. Currently, I live in Butterworth, Pulau Pinang. I am a second-year student at Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP), studying New Media Communication. As a dedicated and passionate learner, I am enthusiastic about exploring the dynamic world of digital media, communication technologies, and creative content. My studies at UniMAP have given me a solid foundation in both theory and practical skills, preparing me for a future career in the ever-evolving media industry. Alongside my studies, I work part-time at KFC Bertam Drive-Thru, balancing my academic life with work experience.</p>

    <h2>My Chosen Career</h2>
    <p>I have chosen to pursue a career as a designer because I am passionate about creativity, visual storytelling, and problem-solving through design. As a New Media Communication student, I am constantly inspired by how design can influence perception, deliver messages effectively, and create meaningful user experiences. I aspire to work in areas such as graphic design, UI/UX, or digital content creation, where I can combine artistic skills with technology to produce engaging and impactful visuals. Being a designer allows me to express ideas in innovative ways while contributing to projects that make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives.</p>
